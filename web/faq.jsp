                                If you don't have your Ngumbi page set as your homepage yet, or you are using
                                someone else's device, then: 
                            </p>

                                <li>Type in your Ngumbi username and hit Enter</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                How's that for easy and fast? Set it as your homepage to use it often.  Save it
                                as a bookmark in your smartphone's web browser.  Use it for quick access to
                                your links if you're at someone else's computer.  You get the idea, use it how you want.

                                &quot;Ngumbi&quot; is the Chichewa word for flying termites found in Africa that sometimes
                                make a tasty fried snack. For more information

                                This site isn't related to real ngumbi at all so I hope no ngumbi fans are offended. 
                                I got the idea from a friend in Malawi and one of the biggest reasons for the name 
                                is that it wasn't taken!
                                Also, it's one word and short so it's easy to recognize and remember.

                                Currently you can only have one or two columns. An option to change
                                the number of columns is definitely on the list of features to add.
                                Stay tuned.
