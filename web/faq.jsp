                            <p>
                                Ngumbi is the Chichewa word for flying termites found in Africa that sometimes
                                make a tasty fried snack.  For more information
                                <a href="http://malawi-andy.blogspot.com/2005/03/ngumbi.html">go here</a>.
                                This site isn't related to real ngumbi at all but I suppose you could make
                                a stretch and say that like the ngumbi insect, this web site flies light
                                and... is tasty.
                                I hope no ngumbi fans are offended.  I got the idea from a friend
                                in Malawi and one of the biggest reasons for the name is that it wasn't taken!
                                Also, it's one word and short so it's easy to recognize
                                        and remember.
                                It could have been more self-explanatory, like mylaunchpad.com, but I guess the sitter
                                who owned that domain didn't like my offer. I don't know why.
                            </p>

                                Currently you can only have one or two columns.  An option to change
                                the number of columns is definitely on the list of features to add.
                                Stay tuned.

                                No. Google, Yahoo!, and others make their search feature available for people
                                and businesses to put on their websites for free (because it makes money).
